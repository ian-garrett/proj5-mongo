# proj5-mongo
Simple list of dated memos kept in MongoDB database

## What is here

A simple Flask app that displays all the dated memos it finds in a MongoDB database.
I plan on expanding on the styling and error-testing, but as is this application takes
a date and message from a user and turns it into a memo. It then inserts the memo into
a memo list that can be seen by the user. The user can go through and delete any memo
at will. The memo's are sorted by date, from oldest to newest. Like I said, I plan on
adding more features, but wanted to get something completed that fulfills the basic 
requirements for this project.

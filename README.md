# proj5-mongo
Simple list of dated memos kept in MongoDB database

## What is here

A simple Flask app that displays all the dated memos it finds in a MongoDB database.
This application takesa date and message from a user and turns it into a memo. It 
then inserts the memo into a memo list that can be seen by the user. The user can 
go through and delete any memo at will. The memos are sorted by date, from oldest
to newest.
